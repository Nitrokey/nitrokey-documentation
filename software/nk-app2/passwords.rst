Password entries may consist of:

* Login

* OTP (HOTP or TOTP)

All fields are optional and can be edited and added at any time using the "Edit" button.

Usage
-----

Entries are divided into two categories: unprotected (shown as an open lock) and protected (shown as a closed lock). Unprotected entries can be accessed directly. Protected entries can only be accessed with the PIN. 

You can choose to create a protected entry by checking the "Protect with PIN" box when adding a new entry.

You also have the option to require user presence in the form of a required touch on the Nitrokey 3 to access the entry by checking the "Require User Presence" box.
