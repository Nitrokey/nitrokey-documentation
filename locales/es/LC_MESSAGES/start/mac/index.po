"4. Change the Admin PIN (default: ``12345678``) and then the User PIN "
"(default: ``123456``) to your own choices. - The PIN must consist of at "
"least 14 characters (starting from RTM.8), can contain any character (not"
" only numbers). Do not select only numbers. If your environment allows "
"that, use emoticons or national characters. - The longer the PIN the "
"better. It is possible to use 6 randomly selected words instead as well "
"for the same or better security than random character string. - Use ‘gpg "
"–card-edit’ -> ‘admin’ -> ‘passwd’ to achieve this (for Admin PIN case). "
"- Please be careful to change Admin PIN first and User PIN second! "
"Otherwise the admin-less mode got activated, see `this instructions "
"<https://www.fsij.org/doc-gnuk/gnuk-passphrase-setting.html#>`__ for "
"further information. 5. KDF-DO allows for a shorter PIN of 8 characters "
"minimum. Please use greater length for the increased security."

"OpenPGP/GnuPG is popular among individuals, S/MIME/x.509 is mostly used "
