"The following instructions explain the generation of OpenPGP keys and how"
" to copy them to the Nitrokey. This method has the advantage of providing"
" a backup of the keys in case of losing or breaking the Nitrokey. The "
"instructions are based on the command line interface of GnuPG. Thus, you "
"need to have GnuPG installed on your system. The newest GnuPG version for"
" Windows can be found `here <https://www.gpg4win.org/>`__ and the newest "
"version for MacOS can be found `here <https://gpgtools.org/>`__. Users of"
" Linux systems please install GnuPG with help of the package manager."
