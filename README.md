# Nitrokey Documentation

## Local build

Be sure to have a recent python installed, then:

```
make
```

The (english) result is to be found in `dist/en`, to show run:
```
firefox dist/en/index.html
```

## More Makefile Targets

* `clean` will clean up generated files
* `cleaner` includes `venv/`
* `check` runs `rstcheck` for the sources
* `venv` creates a virtualenv with all deps
* `docs` first target, default, will quick-build the english docs
* `pkg` assembles a package for deployment in `dist` (unused)

## Guidelines

Follow these guidlines to write uniform and comprehensive documentation.

* Use dashes to separate words in file names (e.g. `file-name.rst`).

### Headlines

When writing title case headlines, major words are capitalized while minor words are lowercase.

* Major words are nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, and basically any word four letters or longer.
* Minor words are conjunctions that are three letters or less (e.g. and, or, nor, but), short prepositions (at, by, for, in, of, on), and all articles (a, an, the).

In addition, the following words should be capitalized under title case:

* The first word of the title — including minor words.
* The first word after any punctuation (semicolon, em dash, end punctuation, etc.) except for commas.
* Words four letters or longer (With, After, Then, etc.).
* All major words — including post-hyphen words (“Last-Minute” as opposed to “Last-minute”).

### Indents

Make sure to always compile locally and look out for bad indentations. The most common issue is that
bad indentations will lead to a quoted block. E.g., this is bad:

.. code-block: rst
    text before code-block
    
    .. code-block: bash

        blabla

The following is bad, mind the bad indentations between the text and the code-block.

.. code-block: rst
    text before code-block

     .. code-block: bash

         blabla


### Boxes

Boxes like note, warning, and important should only contain added information.
The author has to make sure, that if one would imaging removing all boxes in a certain article, it should still make sense and lead to the expected goal.

### Redirects

If you rename files or change the structure of the documentation (e.g. you change the name of a folder) you will need to create a redirect in order that old links with the old structure will still be able to find the desired documentation and will not be a dead link.

To do this you will need to add a rule in this file: `redirects/.htaccess`

You can find instructions and examples at the beginning of the file.
