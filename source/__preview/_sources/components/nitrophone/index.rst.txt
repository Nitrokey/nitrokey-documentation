1. Set up a six-digit PIN to protect the phone. In cooperation with the security chip, this will ensure high security while maintaining good usability.

2. For extra hardening (optional): Go to Settings -> System -> Developer Options and disable the "OEM unlocking" setting. Afterwards disable the "Developer Options".

3. Please familiarize yourself with `using your GrapheneOS <https://grapheneos.org/usage>`__.
