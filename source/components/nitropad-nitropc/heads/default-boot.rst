Default Boot
============

.. contents:: :local:

If you have installed a new operating system, it may be that default boot is not yet assigned. If this is the case, please proceed as described below.

1. Select “Default boot”.

2. Heads informs you that it does not yet know any default. First you
   agree to the update of the checksums.

3. Confirm the process with Enter.

4. Now insert the Nitrokey if this is not already the case and confirm
   with Enter. Then you have to enter the User PIN of the Nitrokey.

.. code-block:: bash

       Please confirm that your GPG card is inserted [Y/n]:

       Verifying presence of GPG card...

       XXXXXXX: XXXXXXXXXX
       Please unlock the card

       Number: XXXX XXXXXX
       Holder: 
       Counter: X
       PIN: 

Now the NitroPad marks the files that changed by the update as verified.

5. Confirm the process with Enter.

       Do you wish to add a disk encryption to the TPM [Y/n]:

       Please confirm that your GPG card is inserted [Y/n]:

       Verifying presence of GPG card...

       XXXXXXX: XXXXXXXXXX
       Please unlock the card

Changing default kernel
-----------------------

This is a workaround for Heads v1.1 bug, which does not allow to change the kernel to the one later (lower) in the list.

Usual way would be to go to ``Options -> Boot Options -> Show OS boot menu``, selecting the kernel and making it default, however the latter is not working at the moment. Instead please use the following workaround:

1. Start recovery console and remove the default boot files. Please make
   sure the correct files are removed. Here 2 default files were
   available:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /
   $ mount -o remount,rw /boot
   $ ls /boot/kexec_default.*.txt
   kexec_default.1.txt kexec_default.2.txt
   $ rm /boot/kexec_default.*.txt -v
   removed '/boot/kexec_default.1.txt'
   removed '/boot/kexec_default.2.txt'
   $ reboot

2. Sign all current boot files with:
   ``Options --> Update checksums and sign all files in /boot``
3. Return to main menu and select default boot
   ``Main Menu --> Default boot``
4. Agree to select default kernel (screen:
   ``No Default Boot Option Configured`` )
5. Select the desired kernel to work as the default
6. Select 2nd option: ``Make <kernel version> the default``
7. Save the kernel with accepting default options (proceed, do not agree
   for TPM encryption, confirm GPG card):

.. code-block:: bash

   Saving... Proceed (Y/n): Y
   Do you wish... to the TPM (y/N): N
   Please confirm... inserted (Y/n): Y

6. Enter PIN for the Nitrokey Pro/Storage device to execute signing
   process
7. The selected kernel will boot and it will be the default one the next
   time when selecting ``Default Boot`` option from the menu.
