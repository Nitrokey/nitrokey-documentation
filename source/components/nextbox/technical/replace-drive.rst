Replace Internal Hard-Drive
===========================

.. contents:: :local:

.. warning::
   Please do this only, if you know what you are doing. By modifying the NextBox you void
   your warranty for at least the hardware of the NextBox. These steps are generally not
   covered by the support, you are modifying your NextBox at your own risk!

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Linux(-like) operating system
* 2.5'' hard-drive with a max height of 15mm, most are 7mm
* A user which can acquire root-rights using ``sudo``
* The following commands must be available: ``sudo``, ``parted``, ``mkfs.ext4``, ``bash``
* At least a basic understanding about mounting / unmounting and shell-scripts (execution)
* Phillips Screwdriver
* Set up the ssh-access on your NextBox

.. warning::
   The script which is used will acquire root rights to wipe the hard-drive you pass to the
   script. **Be extremely careful to pass the correct device to the script, if you pass your
   system partition, this script will destroy your runnning OS!** Any data on the passed hard-drive
   will inevitably be deleted!


.. hint::
   Read the following steps completely and thoroughly **before executing
   them**, if you do not understand what a certain step means this might be an
   indication that you should not do this by yourself.

Prepare New Hard-Disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Get your ``nextbox.conf`` file from your original hard-disk using ssh, it is located on your
   NextBox inside the ``/srv/nextbox`` directory
2. Save your ``nextbox.conf`` on your computer
3. Get the following script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrokey/nextbox/master/assembly/simple_prepare_harddrive.sh 
4. Make the script executable: ``chmod +x simple_prepare_harddrive.sh``
5. Connect your new hard-disk to your computer
6. Determine your hard-disk's device name (e.g., ``/dev/sdb``) and make sure
   none of its partitions are mounted

   .. warning::
      **Again: think at least twice about the following step. Make sure you are referring to the 
      correct hard-drive device (and NOT a partition, means** ``/dev/sdb1`` **is wrong).** The script will
      decline to do the operation on ``/dev/sda`` as there are good chances this might be your 
      system hard-disk, if you really need this you can comment out lines 23-26 inside the script. 

7. Run the script using the device name you have determined. Once prompted for
   your sudo-password please provide it to allow r/w access to the hard-drive:

   .. code:: shell-session

      $ ./simple_prepare_harddrive.sh <device-name> 
      
   Replace ``<device-name>`` with the respective device name, for example ``/dev/sdb``.
   

8. Watch the script's output for any errors, there should be none
9. At the end of the script you will be asked to mount the created partition
   and copy over the ``nextbox.conf`` (to ``/nextbox``) you copied in step 1.
   and 2., unmount the partition and you have successfully prepared your new
   hard-drive.


Replacement Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Inside the NextBox Nextcloud App go to "System Settings" and switch it off your NextBox using 
   the "Poweroff" button
2. Once the Status LED is shortly off (not entirely, thus very dark) and the Ethernet port LEDs are
   off you can unplug all cables from your NextBox
3. Unscrew all 8 Phillips screws
4. Carefully remove the top-cover (as vertical as possible) first
5. Again carefully, vertically remove the bottom cover, now you see the so-called bridge
6. Unfold the USB-to-SATA cable and put the NextBox bridge upside down onto a electronics friendly
   surface like a desk as shown in the following image

   .. figure:: /components/nextbox/images/technical/nextbox_bridge_backside.jpeg
      :alt: nextbox-backside
      :align: center

7. Unscrew the Phillips screws holding the hard-disk in position (the amount of screws may differ,
   depending on your hard-disk type) shown in the following image:

   .. figure:: /components/nextbox/images/technical/nextbox_bridge_backside_screws.jpeg
      :alt: nextbox-backside-screws
      :align: center

8. Once the screws are removed, push the hard-disk carefully towards the direction shown in the
   image above. Do not push it towards the other direction, you might damage the USB cable.
9. Remove the USB-to-SATA cable from the hard-drive

   .. warning::
      Avoid disconnecting the male-female USB connector to not change the position and bending 
      of the cable. If you have to: be careful to keep the force as small as possible onto the
      90Â° part of the USB extension cable.

10. Connect your previously prepared new hard-drive
11. Carefully slide your new hard-drive into the bridge and fix it into the right position
    using the previously removed screws
12. Fold the USB-to-SATA cable (in circles) into the open space behind the hard-disk.
13. Finally assemble your NextBox again in reverse order using steps 5. to 3.

On first boot after the assembly, give the NextBox enough time to boot and get all necessary 
packages from the internet. **Make sure you have ethernet connected**. You should expect a changing
status LED (yellow shall be first) quite fast (less than 2 minutes). If the status LED does not 
change at all, it is likely that there is something wrong with your hard-drive wiring or 
contents.
