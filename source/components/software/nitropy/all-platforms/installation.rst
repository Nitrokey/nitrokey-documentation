Installing nitropy With pipx
============================

This guide explains how to install nitropy with `pipx <https://pypa.github.io/pipx/>`__. pipx creates a virtual environment for nitropy. This means that nitropy and its dependencies donâ€™t conflict with other packages installed on your system.

.. note::

   **For Windows users:** Windows support is still experimental -- please use with caution. You can also use pre-compiled binaries or a MSI installer, see :doc:`../windows/installation`.

Installation on other distributions/operating systems
-----------------------------------------------------

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Python
""""""
Python is already installed on most macOS and Linux systems or can be downloaded from `python.org <https://python.org>`__.
Currently the supported Python versions are 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13.
See the `Downloading Python Guide <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`__ for more information.

pip
"""
You can install pip with your system package manager or with ``python3 -m ensurepip``. See the `pip Installation Guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__ for more information.

pipx
""""
Before installing nitropy, you have to install and configure pipx::

    $ python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    $ python3 -m pipx ensurepath

See the `pipx Installation Guide <https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/>`__ for more information.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you can install nitropy from the pynitrokey package::

    $ pipx install pynitrokey


nitropy is now available in your path::

    $ nitropy --help

Upgrade 
-------

You can upgrade the package with the following command::

    $ pipx upgrade pynitrokey
    
Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter problems, please make sure that you use the latest version by comparing the output of ``nitropy version`` with the `release list <https://github.com/Nitrokey/pynitrokey/releases>`_ on GitHub.  If an upgrade does not install the latest version, you might be running into one of the following problems.

Wrong Python Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your default Python installation is not in the supported versions list above, you need to specify an alternative to pipx.
Install a supported version of Python and specify the name of its Python executable when calling pipx, for example::

    $ pipx install --python python3.9 pynitrokey
    
libusb-1.0.dylib not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running nitropy on macOS, you might see an error message indicating a missing libusb-1.0.dylib file.  This can be fixed by manually installing libusb, e. g. with homebrew::

    $ brew install libusb

Usage Notes
-----------

All Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use nitropy with a Nitrokey Pro or Nitrokey Storage device, you also have to install `libnitrokey <https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey>`__.

Windows
~~~~~~~

Windows support is still experimental -- please use with caution.

You might have to run nitropy with administrator rights to be able to connect to a device.

Linux
~~~~~

On Linux systems, you also need the Nitrokey udev rules. These are shipped with `libnitrokey <https://github.com/Nitrokey/libnitrokey>`__. Alternatively, you can install them manually::

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-udev-rules/refs/heads/main/41-nitrokey.rules
    $ sudo mv 41-nitrokey.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

See :doc:`../linux/udev` for more information.

Usage of PIV features
---------------------

To be able to use the PIV functionality of nitropy (``nitropy nk3 piv``), you need to install the ``pyscard`` dependency too::

    $ pipx install pynitrokey[pcsc]
