Windows Install
===============

Using our MSI File
------------------

1. `Download <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-app2/releases>`__ the Windows installer (MSI file).

   .. note::
      If you're using Microsoft Edge, the downloaded ``.msi`` might be marked as "untrused" by Windows. To mark it as trusted anyway, click the three dot on the right of the warning, then "keep", then "show more" and finally "keep anyway".

2. Execute the Windows installer to install Nitrokey App 2 to your system.
3. Start Nitrokey App 2 from your applications.

Alternatively, you can download and execute the portable Windows binary without installation.

Silent installations are possible with the parameter **/qn**.
