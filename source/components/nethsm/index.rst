NetHSM
======

This documentation describes the NetHSM software and hardware. The NetHSM software can be either used on the NetHSM hardware, or as a `software container <container/index.html>`__ (e.g. Docker).

The NetHSM software features a `REST API <https://nethsmdemo.nitrokey.com/api_docs/index.html>`_ to perform installation, administration and operational tasks. The recommended way to use a NetHSM is through the tool `nitropy <../software/nitropy/index.html>`_. Alternatively `curl <https://curl.se>`_ can be used to send HTTP requests to the REST API.

If you obtained a new NetHSM hardware, please refer to the chapter `Getting Started <getting-started.html#getting-started>`__ first. In case you want to restore a backup of a NetHSM, please refer to the chapter `Restore <administration.html#restore>`__.

.. important::

   If you use a NetHSM instance with a self-signed certificate, for example using the Docker container, you will have to instruct *nitropy* or *curl* to ignore the validity of the certificate.
   For *nitropy* use the option ``--no-verify-tls`` and for *curl* use the option ``--insecure/-k`` to skip the certificate check.

.. note::

   The examples in this documentation use the environment variable ``NETHSM_HOST``, which contains the IP address or URL of the NetHSM. A NetHSM's default IP address is 192.168.1.1. On a Unix shell the variable can be set with the following command.

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ export NETHSM_HOST="<URL-or-IP-address>"
