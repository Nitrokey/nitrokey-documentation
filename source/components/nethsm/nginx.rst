Nginx
=====

You can configure `nginx <https://nginx.org/>`__ to use NetHSM via the OpenSSL engine which then uses NetHSM's PKCS#11 module.

The certificate file has to be on the disk but the private key can be used from the NetHSM.

A full example is available `below <#example>`__.

OpenSSL Configuration
---------------------

Set up the OpenSSL engine by following the `OpenSSL Engine  setup guide <openssl.html#engine>`__.

Providers aren't supported yet by Nginx.

.. note:: 
   Using the libp11 OpenSSL engine version 0.4.12 or older and a NetHSM with a lot of key will make the initial loading of Nginx slow (more than a minute for 1 thousand keys). It is recommended to use version 0.4.13 or newer or to build the engine from `source <https://github.com/OpenSC/libp11>`__.

Nginx Configuration
-------------------

.. code-block:: nginx

   ssl_engine pkcs11;

   server {
       listen       443 ssl;
       server_name  localhost;

       ssl_certificate      /certs/certificate.pem;

       ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:object=webserver;type=private";

       ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
       ssl_session_timeout  10s;
       ssl_session_tickets off;

       ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  off;

       # HSTS (ngx_http_headers_module is required) (63072000 seconds)
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;

       # OCSP stapling
       ssl_stapling on;
       ssl_stapling_verify on;

       location / {
           root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
           index  index.html index.htm;
       }
     
       error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
       location = /50x.html {
           root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
       }
   }

The ``ssl_certificate`` must point to a certificate file on the disk.

The ``ssl_certificate_key`` can be an OpenSSL configuration. Here we use the OpenSSL engine with the PKCS#11 module and select the private key with the label/ID ``webserver`` and the key type ``private``.

.. code-block:: nginx

   ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:object=webserver;type=private";

.. note:: 
   You must generate the certificate separately and then upload it to the NetHSM. If the certificate on disk and the key in the NetHSM don't match nginx won't start.

libnethsm_pkcs11 Configuration
------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   slots:
     - label: LocalHSM
       description: Local HSM (docker)
       url: "https://192.168.3.161:8443/api/v1"
       operator:
         username: "operator"
         password: "opPassphrase"

To secure the password you can provide it via an `environment variable <pkcs11-setup.html#passwords>`__) or provide it in the nginx configuration:

.. code-block:: nginx

   ssl_certificate_key "engine:pkcs11:pkcs11:object=webserver;type=private;pin=opPassphrase";


Example
-------

If you want to experiment with the `given example <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nethsm-pkcs11/tree/main/container/nginx>`__ use git to clone the `nethsm-pkcs11 repository <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nethsm-pkcs11>`__ and run the following commands:

.. warning::
   Running the generate script deletes the ``webserver`` key and replaces it.

1. Configure a NetHSM, either a real one or a container. See the `getting-started guide <getting-started.html>`__ for more information. Besides an administrator, you are going to need an operator account.
2. Download and install the latest version of the nethsm-pkcs11 driver `available from here <https://github.com/Nitrokey/nethsm-pkcs11/releases>`__.
3. Install the OpenSSL PKCS11 engine as described in the `OpenSSL Manual <openssl.html>`__. You do not need to create a configuration file.
4. Adjust the variables ``HOST``, ``ADMIN_ACCOUNT`` and ``ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PWD`` in ``container/nginx/generate.sh`` such that ``HOST`` contains your NetHSMs URL and port, ``ADMIN_ACCOUNT`` contains an administrator accounts username and ``ADMIN_ACCOUNT_PWD`` the corresponding password. Further configure the absolute path of the OpenSSL PKCS11 engine in ``OPENSSL_PKCS11_ENGINE_PATH`` and the absolute path of the NetHSM PKCS11 library in ``NETHSM_PKCS11_LIBRARY_PATH``.
5. Create a NetHSM PKCS11 configuration file in one of the `known locations <pkcs11-setup.html#configuration>`__, e.g., ``/etc/nitrokey/p11nethsm.conf``. It must have configured an operator account and use the same NetHSM instance specified in the generate script before.
6. Update the PKCS11 configuration in ``container/nginx/p11nethsm.conf`` with your NetHSMs URL and valid operator credentials. 
7. Generate the certificate and key.
  
   .. code-block:: shell-session
   
      ./container/nginx/generate.sh

8. Build the container.
  
   .. code-block:: shell-session
    
      docker build -f container/nginx/Dockerfile . -t pkcs-nginx 

9. Run the container.
  
   .. code-block:: shell-session
    
      docker run -p 9443:443 -p 9080:80 pkcs-nginx
  
The NGINX test page will be available at `https://localhost:9443/ <https://localhost:9443/>`__.
Note that your browser, will warn you that the websites certificate is self-signed.
