Nitrokey FIDO2 FAQ
==================

.. faq:: Which Operating Systems are supported?

.. faq:: What can I use the Nitrokey for?

   See the `overview <https://www.nitrokey.com/products/nitrokeys>`_ of supported use cases.

.. faq:: What happens if I lose my FIDO device?

   When securing accounts using FIDO (two-factor authentication and
   passwordless login), you should configure another factor in your account as
   a backup. Depending on the service this backup factor can be a phone number,
   an app or even a second Nitrokey FIDO2. If you lose a Nitrokey FIDO2, you
   can still log in with the second Nitrokey FIDO2 (or with another second
   factor).

.. faq:: How large is the storage capacity?

   The Nitrokey FIDO2 doesn't contain storage capability for ordinary data (it can
   only store cryptographic keys and certificates).

.. faq:: How to use Nitrokey FIDO2 with Azure Entra ID (Active Directory)?

   After `disabling Enforce Attestation`_ Nitrokey FIDO2 is supported by Azure Entra ID out of the box.
