Touch Button And LED Behavior
-----------------------------

The first FIDO operation is automatically accepted within two seconds
after connecting Nitrokey Passkey. In this case touching the touch button
is not required.

Multiple operations can be accepted by a single touch. For this, keep
the touch button touched for up to 10 seconds.
