.. note::
   Secure element support for OpenPGP Card is available since stable firmware v1.7.0. Any new 
   devices will have this automatically activated. For devices already in use, the
   user has to `manually switch`_ as described in the FAQ.


On top of the stable firmware for the Nitrokey 3, we also provide a `Test Firmware`_, which
comes with additional functionalities, which are not (yet) included into the stable firmware.

**Using the Test Firmware is not recommended for production environments, there might be 
incompatibilities between test and stable firmware upgrades - please use with caution. Especially
data migrations from test to stable firmwares will not be implemented.**
