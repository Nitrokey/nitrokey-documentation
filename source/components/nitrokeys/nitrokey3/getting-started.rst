Getting Started
===============

The Nitrokey 3 supports two-factor authentication (2FA) and
passwordless authentication:

-  With **passwordless authentication**, entering a password is replaced
   by logging in with the Nitrokey 3 and a PIN.

-  With **two-factor authentication** (2FA), the Nitrokey 3 is
   checked in addition to the password.

The Nitrokey 3 can be used with any current browser and with the `Nitrokey App 2 </software/nk-app2/>`__.

Passwordless Authentication
---------------------------

1. Open a web page that supports FIDO2.
2. Log in to the website and go to “Set up security key” in the security
   settings of your account.
3. Now you need to set a PIN for your Nitrokey 3.
4. Touch the button of your Nitrokey 3 when prompted.
5. Once you have successfully configured the device, you will need to
   activate your Nitrokey 3 this way each time you log in, after
   entering your PIN.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
-------------------------------

1. Open one of the `websites that support FIDO
   U2F <https://www.dongleauth.com/>`__.
2. Log in to the website and enable two-factor authentication in your
   account settings. (In most cases you will find a link to the
   documentation of the supported web service at
   `dongleauth.com <https://www.dongleauth.com/>`__.)
3. Register your Nitrokey 3 in the account settings by touching the
   button to activate the Nitrokey 3. After you have successfully
   configured the device, you must activate the Nitrokey 3 this way
   each time you log in.

You are now ready to go.
