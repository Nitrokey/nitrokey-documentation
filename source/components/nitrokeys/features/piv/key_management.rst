Key Slots
---------

The PIV smart card can hold certificates for different purposes.
For each purpose the private key and its corresponding certificate are stored in a key slot.

+-------+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Slot  | Application            | Description                                           |

| 82-95 | Retired Key Management | The private keys and certificates in these slots were |
|       |                        | used for key management applications and are still    |
|       |                        | there to provide backward compatibility.              |

|       |                        | are used to authenticate the cardholder.              |

|       |                        | are used to sign emails and files.                    |

|       |                        | are used to encrypt emails and files.                 |

|       |                        | are used for physical operations, such as building    |
|       |                        | access or time recording. Support from the respective |
|       |                        | system is a prerequisite.                             |

Algorithms
----------

The PIV smart card uses asymmetric and symmetric algorithms. The asymmetric algorithms are used for the user private keys and the symmetric algorithms for the management key.

Supported asymmetric key algorithms:

* RSA 2048
* nistp256

Supported symmetric key algorithms:

* AES 256
* 3DES (TDES)

.. warning::
   It is not recommended to use the 3DES (TDES) algorithm.

Management Key
--------------

For compatibility reasons, the default management key is the following 3DES (TDES) key (24 bytes in hexadecimal):

::

    0102030405060708 0102030405060708 0102030405060708 

Key Generation
--------------

The PIV smart card can generate a new private key on the Nitrokey.

The command below will create a private key in key slot ``9a`` for the user with the subject name ``John Doe`` and subject alternative name ``jd@nitrokey.local``.

::

   nitropy nk3 piv --experimental generate-key --key 9a --subject-name "John Doe" --subject-alt-name-upn "jd@nitrokey.local"
