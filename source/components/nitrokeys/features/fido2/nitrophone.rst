FIDO2 on Android / NitroPhone
*****************************

.. Note::
    For more information about FIDO2, FIDO2 U2F and Passkeys, check our `blog article  <https://www.nitrokey.com/blog/2022/fido2-webauthn-passkeys-2022-and-2023>`_.


In order to use passkeys being stored on a Nitrokey with your NitroPhone we recommend using the open source app `Authnkey  <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/pl.lebihan.authnkey/>`_. Alternatively you could use Google Play Services.

Once Authnkey is installed on your NitroPhone you will need to launch it and set it as the default passkey provider with the "Enable" button and switch Authnkey as your preferred service. When this is done your NitroPhone will be ready to use your Nitrokey and FIDO2. Both NFC and USB connectivity works. You can test this with `WebAuthn.io  <https://webauthn.io/>`_.

Authnkey also comes with useful features such as:

- Show the Nitrokey status with its attributes.
- List saved credentials.
- Change the FIDO2 PIN.
