FIDO2 on Android / NitroPhone
*****************************

.. Note::
    For more information about FIDO2, FIDO2 U2F and Passkeys, check our `blog article  <https://www.nitrokey.com/blog/2022/fido2-webauthn-passkeys-2022-and-2023>`_.


In order to use FIDO2 with your NitroPhone we recommend using `Authnkey  <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/pl.lebihan.authnkey/>`_ which is an open source app that permits to use FIDO2 without the Google Play Services.

Once Authnkey is installed on your NitroPhone you will need to launch it and set it as the default passkey provider with the "Enable" button and switch Authnkey as your preferred service.

When this is done your NitroPhone will be ready to use FIDO2 tokens.

You can test this with `WebAuthn.io  <https://webauthn.io/>`_.

NFC and USB token will work.

Authnkey also comes with useful features such as:

- Show the token status with its attributes.

- List the saved credentials.

- Change the FIDO2 PIN.
