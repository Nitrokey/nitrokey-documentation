Introduction
------------

This guide will walk you through the configuration of Linux to use FIDO Universal 2nd Factor, i.e. FIDO U2F with ``libpam-u2f`` and Nitrokey FIDO2.

If you want to login to you computer using `Nitrokey Pro
2, <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-pro-2-nitrokey-pro-2-3>`__ `Nitrokey Storage
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-storage-2-56>`__ and `Nitrokey Start <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-sta-nitrokey-start-6>`__ you can visit the instructions available `here <../openpgp-card/desktop-login/pam.html>`_.

Requirements
------------

-  Ubuntu 20.04 with Gnome Display Manager.

-  Nitrokey FIDO2 configured following `these
   instructions <https://docs.nitrokey.com/fido2/linux>`__.

CLI Method
''''''''''

1. **Create a backup user and give it root privileges**

   You can do so by using these commands:

   .. rstcheck: ignore-next-code-block
   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo adduser <backup_user>
      $ sudo usermod -aG sudo <backup_user>

   In case you prefer to setup U2F for a single user, and are locked out of your
   user session, you would still be able to login with the ``<backup_user>``, and
   proceed with the maintenance.

   .. warning::

      The following guide can potentially lock you out of your computer.
      You should be aware of these risks, as it is recommended to first use
      the instructions below on a secondary computer, or after a full
      backup.

      You might lose access to your data after configuring `PAM
      modules <https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/pam.8.html>`__.


2. **Set up the** ``rules`` **to recognize the Nitrokey FIDO2**

   Under ``/etc/udev/rules.d`` download ``41-nitrokey.rules``

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
      $ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrokey/nitrokey-udev-rules/main/41-nitrokey.rules

   And restart ``udev`` service

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo systemctl restart udev

3. **Install** ``libpam-u2f``

   On Ubuntu 20.04 it is possible to download directly ``libpam-u2f`` from the official repos

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt install libpam-u2f

   .. note::

      Click for more options

      -  Alternatively you can build ``libpam-u2f`` from
         `Git <https://github.com/phoeagon/pam-u2f>`__.

      -  To verify that the library is properly installed enter the
         following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         $ file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/pam_u2f.so

      The Output should be something like the following:

      .. rstcheck: ignore-next-code-block
      .. code-block:: bash

         /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/pam_u2f.so: \ ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV),\ dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=1d55e1b11a97be2038c6a139579f6c0d91caedb1, stripped

4. **Prepare the Directory**

   Create ``.config/Nitrokey/`` under your home directory

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ mkdir ~/.config/Nitrokey

   And plug your Nitrokey FIDO2.

   Once done with the preparation, we can start to configure the computer to use the Nitrokey FIDO2 for 2nd factor authentication at login and ``sudo``.

5. **Generate the U2F config file**

   To generate the configuration file we will use the ``pamu2fcfg`` utility that comes with the ``libpam-u2f``. For convenience, we will directly write the output of the utility to the ``u2f_keys`` file under ``.config/Nitrokey``. First plug your Nitrokey FIDO2 (if you did not already), and enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Nitrokey/u2f_keys

   Once you run the command above, you will need to touch the device while it flashes. Once done, ``pamu2fcfg`` will append its output the ``u2f_keys`` in the following format:

   .. code-block:: bash

      <username>:Zx...mw,04...0a

   Note, the output will be much longer, but sensitive parts have been removed here. For better security, and once the config file generated, we will move the ``.config/Nitrokey`` directory under the ``etc/``
   directory with this command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo mv ~/.config/Nitrokey /etc

   .. tip::

      -  The file under ``.config/Nitrokey`` must be named ``u2f_keys``

      -  It is recommended to first test the instructions with a single
         user. For this purpose the previous command takes the ``-u``
         option, to specify a user, like in the example below:

         .. rstcheck: ignore-next-code-block
         .. code-block:: bash

            $ pamu2fcfg -u <username> > ~/.config/Nitrokey/u2f_keys

      -  For individual user configuration you should point to the home
         directory in the next step, or not include the ``authfile`` option
         in the PAM configuration.

6. **Backup**

   This step is optional, however it is advised to have a backup Nitrokey in the case of loss, theft or destruction of your Nitrokey FIDO.

   To set up a backup key, repeat the procedure above, and use ``pamu2fcfg -n``. This will omit the ``<username>`` field, and the output can be appended to the line with your ``<username>`` like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      <username>:Zx...mw,04...0a:xB...fw,04...3f

7. **Modify the Pluggable Authentication Module** ``PAM``

   The final step is configure the PAM module files under ``/etc/pam.d/``. In this guide we will modify the ``common-auth`` file as it handles the authentication settings which are common to all services, but other options are possible. You can modify the file with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd /etc/pam.d
      $ sudo $editor common-auth

   And add the following lines at the top of the file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      #Nitrokey FIDO2 config
      auth    sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/Nitrokey/u2f_keys cue [cue_prompt=Please touch the device.] prompt nouserok

   .. tip::

      -  Since we are using Central Authentication Mapping, we need to tell
         ``pam_u2f`` the location of the file to use with the ``authfile``
         option.

      -  If you often forget to insert the key, ``prompt`` option make
         ``pam_u2f`` print ``Insert your U2F device, then press ENTER.``
         and give you a chance to insert the Nitrokey.

      -  If you would like to be prompted to touch the Nitrokey, ``cue``
         option will make ``pam_u2f`` print ``Please touch the device.``
         message. You can change the message in ``[cue_prompt=Please touch the device.]``.

      -  `nouserok` will ensure that you can still login using the username and
         password, you might want to remove this at some point once the setup
         is working and you don't want regular username & password based logins.

   Once we modified the ``common-auth``, we can save and exit the file.

   You can test the configuration by typing ``sudo ls`` in the terminal. You should be prompted the message ``Please touch the device.`` and have a similar output on the terminal:

   .. code-block:: bash

      nitrouser@nitrouser:~$ sudo ls
      [sudo] password for nitrouser:  Please touch the device.

   You can also test your configuration by logging out of the user session and logging back. A similar screen should be displayed once you you unplug/replug yout Nitrokey FIDO2 and type your password:

   .. figure:: images/desktop-login/u2f-fido-pam-2.png
      :alt: img6

Usage
-----

After the PAM module modification, you will be able to test your configuration right away, but it is recommended to reboot your computer, and unplug/replug the Nitrokey FIDO2.

Once you have properly tested the instructions in this guide (and set up a backup), it is recommended to use either the ``required`` or the ``requisite`` control flag instead of ``sufficient``.

The flags ``required`` and ``requisite`` provide a tighter access control, and will make the Nitrokey FIDO2 necessary to login, and/or use the configured service.

If you need more information about Control Flags in the ``PAM``
configuration line, you may see the last section of this guide to understand the difference, and the implications of using each of them.

PAM Modules
''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are several PAM modules files that can be modified according to your needs:

-  By modifying ``/etc/pam.d/common-auth`` file, you will be able to use
   you Nitrokey FIDO for 2nd factor authentication for graphic login and
   ``sudo``. Note: ``common-auth`` should be modified by adding the
   additional configuration line at the end of the file.

-  If you wish to use FIDO U2F authentication solely for Gnome’s graphic
   login, you might prefer to modify the\ ``/etc/pam.d/gdm-password``

-  Alternatively you can just modify the ``/etc/pam.d/sudo`` file if you
   wish to use FIDO U2F when using the ``sudo`` command.

Control Flags
''''''''''''''''''''''''

In step 7 we have used the ``sufficient`` control flag to determine the behavior of the PAM module when the Nitrokey is plugged or not. However it is possible to change this behavior by using the following control flags:

-  ``required``: This is the most critical flag. The module result must
   be successful for authentication to continue. This flag can lock you
   out of your computer if you do not have access to the Nitrokey.

-  ``requisite``: Similar to ``required`` however, in the case where a
   specific module returns a failure, control is directly returned to
   the application, or to the superior PAM stack. This flag can also
   lock you out of your computer if you do not have access to the
   Nitrokey.

-  ``sufficient``: The module result is ignored if it fails. The
   ``sufficient`` flag considered to be safe for testing purposes.

-  ``optional``: The success or failure of this module is only important
   if it is the only module in the stack associated with this
   service+type. The ``optional`` flag is considered to be safe to use
   for testing purposes.

.. warning::

   -  If ``required`` or ``requisite`` is set, the failure of U2F
      authentication will cause a failure of the overall authentication.
      Failure will occur when the configured Nitrokey FIDO is not
      plugged, lost or destroyed.

   -  You will lose access to your computer if you mis-configured the
      PAM module *and* used the ``required`` or ``requisite`` flags.

   -  You will also lose the ability to use ``sudo`` if you set up
      Central Authentication Mapping *and* used the ``required`` or
      ``requisite`` flags.
