Protect your domain name resolution using DNSSEC and a Nitrokey HSM as secure key store. It's based on Smartcard-HSM which is why the following resources apply:

* Luis D Espinoza Sanchez & Eberhard W Lisse held a `session on using the SmartCard-HSM for DNSSEC <https://singapore52.icann.org/en/schedule/mon-tech/presentation-dnssec-card-signing-09feb15-en.pdf>`__ at the 2015 ICAAN Meeting in Singapore.
* Jan-Piet Mens wrote a nice article about `integrating the SmartCard-HSM with PowerDNS <https://jpmens.net/2015/03/30/powerdns-with-a-smartcard-hsm-for-dnssec/>`__.
* Integration with `OpenDNSSEC <https://www.opendnssec.org/>`__ has been successfully tested.
