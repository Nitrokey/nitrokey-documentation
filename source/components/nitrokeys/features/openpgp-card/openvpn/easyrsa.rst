OpenVPN Configuration with Easy-RSA
===================================

.. product-table:: nk3 pro hsm storage start

.. contents:: :local:
   :depth: 2

.. note::

  This guide is work-in-progress, and will be updated accordinlgy. Please take this status into consideration.

This guide shows how to configure OpenVPN clients to login using a `Nitrokey Pro
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-pro-2-nitrokey-pro-2-3>`__ or a `Nitrokey Storage
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/de_DE/shop/product/nitrokey-storage-2-56>`__. For software key management we will be using `Easy-RSA <https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa>`__, a utility that has been evolving alongside OpenVPN.

To sign the certificates, we will use a `Nitrokey HSM
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/nkhs2-nitrokey-hsm-2-7>`__ set up as `Certificate Authority <../certificate-authority.html#creating-the-intermediate-certificate-authority>`_, however this guide does not cover the set up of the CA itself (it is clear and `well documented here <../certificate-authority.html#sign-a-server-certificate>`_).

We will use Easy-RSA, because it seems to provide some flexibility, and allows key management via external PKIs. We will use it on the server to issue the signing request, and repeat the same process on the client. The Certificate Signing Requests will be signed by the CA on the Nitorkey HSM, and re-transmitted to the server and the client.


Prerequisites
-------------

In the following documentation we will require 3 different machines as following:

-  OpenVPN server (v. 2.5) on Debian 10 (EC2 virtual machine - AWS)

-  OpenVPN client (v. 2.4.9) on Fedora 30 (local machine)

-  The Certificate Authority will be accessible from a standalone
   machine with Fedora 30 (local machine)

To interact with the devices we will require `OpenSC
0.20 <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>`__ installed on the client and CA machine (the local machines). You can follow the instructions to set it up in `this link (*Unix) <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/Compiling-and-Installing-on-Unix-flavors>`__.

To download the dependencies on Fedora machines we can this instruction:

.. code-block:: bash

   su -c 'dnf install readline-devel openssl-devel libxslt docbook-style-xsl pcsc-lite-devel automake autoconf libtool gcc zlib-devel'

For Debian Linux, more recent OpenSC packages are available `here <https://github.com/Nitrokey/opensc-build>`__.

We will use the following Nitrokeys for physical key management:

-  An authentication key using the `Nitrokey Pro 2
   (pdf) <https://www.nitrokey.com/files/doc/Nitrokey_Pro_factsheet.pdf>`__

-  A Certificate Authority (CA) using the `Nitrokey HSM 2
   (pdf) <https://www.nitrokey.com/files/doc/Nitrokey_HSM_factsheet.pdf>`__

As a reminder, to build a Certificate Authority on Nitrokey HSM 2, you may follow the instructions available `in the documentation <../certificate-authority.html#sign-a-server-certificate>`_.

Alternatively you may set up your own CA on a `on a separate machine <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-a-certificate-authority-ca-on-ubuntu-20-04>`__, or use the OpenVPN tutorial which also relies on `Easy-RSA <https://openvpn.net/community-resources/setting-up-your-own-certificate-authority-ca/>`__. The last 2 options rely on software solutions for key management.

--------------

Server side
-----------

1. Install OpenVPN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. First we need to enable IP Forwarding by editing ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` file

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ editor /etc/sysctl.conf

    2. Uncomment or edit accordingly the following line

        .. code-block:: bash

            net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

    3. Close after saving it, and enter this command

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ sysctl -p

		Once IP forwarding is done, we will need to download the latest release of OpenvPN for our Debian 10 server, according to `these instructions <https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/OpenvpnSoftwareRepos>`__:

    4. Change to root and download the GPG key that signed the package

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ sudo -s 
			# wget -O - https://swupdate.openvpn.net/repos/repo-public.gpg|apt-key add -

    5. Add the URL of the adequate OpenVPN packages to the ``sources.list`` file

        .. code-block:: bash

            # echo "deb http://build.openvpn.net/debian/openvpn/release/2.5 buster main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openvpn-aptrepo.list
            # exit

        We downloaded OpenVPN 2.5 as “password prompt” requires at least OpenVPN `version
        2.4.8 <https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/1215>`__ to login.

    6. Next we download OpenVPN

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ sudo apt install openvpn

        If you want to check the version, it possible by calling ``--version``
        and print the following:

        ::

            $ sudo openvpn --version
            OpenVPN 2.5_beta3 x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Sep  1 2020

2. Install Easy-RSA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	To build the PKI, we will download the latest version of Easy-RSA on the server and client machines. To get the latest release, go to the `Releases page on the official EasyRSA GitHub project <https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases>`__, copy the download link for the file ending in ``.tgz``, and then paste it into the following command:

    1. Download the latest release

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ cd ~
            $ wget -P ~/ https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa/releases/download/v3.0.7/EasyRSA-3.0.7.tgz

    2. Extract the tarball

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ cd ~
            $ tar xvf EasyRSA-3.0.7.tgz
            $ mv EasyRSA-3.0.7/ easyrsa/ # rename folder

3. Create a PKI for OpenVPN server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Before you can create your OpenVPN server’s private key and certificate, you need to create a local Public Key Infrastructure directory on your OpenVPN server. You will use this directory to manage the server and clients’ certificate requests, instead of making them directly on your CA server.

	To build a PKI directory on your OpenVPN server, you’ll need to populate a file called ``vars`` with some default values.

		1. Create a ``vars`` file

			.. code-block:: bash

				$ touch ~/easyrsa/vars
				$ cd easyrsa/
				$ editor vars

		2. Once the file is opened, paste in the following two lines

			.. code-block:: bash

				set_var EASYRSA_ALGO "ec"
				set_var EASYRSA_DIGEST "sha512"

			These are the only two lines that you need in this ``vars`` file on your OpenVPN server since it will not be used as a Certificate Authority. They will ensure that your private keys and certificate requests are configured to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to generate keys, and secure signatures for your clients and OpenVPN server.

			In regards to the choice of the cryptographic algorithms, I follow the model in `this tutorial <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-centos-8>`__, and you can customize these according to your specific needs.

		3. Initialize the PKI

			Once you have populated the ``vars`` file you can proceed with creating the PKI directory. To do so, run the easyrsa script with the init-pki option:

				.. code-block:: bash

					$ ./easyrsa init-pki

			After you’ve initialized your PKI on the OpenVPN server, you are ready to move on to the next step, which is creating an OpenVPN server certificate request and private key.

4. Create ``server.req`` and ``server.key``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	Now that your OpenVPN server has all the prerequisites installed, the next step is to generate a key pair composed of a private key (to keep secret), and a Certificate Signing Request (``.csr``) on your OpenVPN server.

	In general terms, on systems where we generate a key and request, these files are left unencrypted by using the ``nopass`` argument, since servers usually need to start up without any password input. This generates an *unencrypted key*, so mind *protect its access and file permissions* carefully.

	.. tip::

		Configuration notes from OpenVPN:

		1. The server, and each client, must have their own cert and key
			file. The server and all clients will use the same CA file.
		2. Server certificate should have the following:

		-  ``keyUsage:  digitalSignature, keyEncipherment``

		-  ``extendedKeyUsage: serverAuth``

	1. Create the signing request for the server

		Navigate to the ``~/easyrsa`` directory on your OpenVPN Server as your non-root user, and enter the following commands:

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ cd easyrsa/
			$ ./easyrsa gen-req server nopass

		This will create a private key for the server and a certificate request file called ``server.req``.

		Once you have a signed certificate, you’ll transfer it back to the OpenVPN server.

	2. Copy the key to the OpenVPN server directory

		.. code-block:: bash

			$ sudo cp /home/admin/EasyRSA/pki/private/server.key /etc/openvpn/server/

	After completing these steps, you have successfully created a private key for your OpenVPN server. You have also generated a Certificate Signing Request for the OpenVPN server.

	.. tip::

		File extensions for certificate signing requests

		The file extension that is adopted by the CA and HSM tutorial
		indicates the creation of a ``.csr`` file, however Easy-RSA creates
		certificate signing requests with a ``.req`` extension.

		We will use interchangeably both extensions, while making sure that
		we transfer the right files to the Certificate Authority, and
		generate a final certificate with a ``.crt`` extension.

	In the next section of this guide, we will sign a ``.req`` file with our CA on deployed on the HSM 2 device. For this purpose, I will use a dedicated machine to sign the requests.

5. Sign and retrieve ``server.crt``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    The following instructions require the transfer of the ``server.req``
    (or ``server.csr``) file to the CA system.

    The transfer itself is not security sensitive, though it is wise to verify if the received file matches the sender’s copy, if the transport is untrusted.

    In order to go through these steps, I will extensively rely on `these instructions <../certificate-authority.html#creating-the-intermediate-certificate-authority>`_, to sign the certificate signing requests, once we generated them with Easy-RSA.

    1. Sign the ``server.req`` file

        On the local machine dedicated to access the HSM, we will use the tools provided by Opensc 0.20 in order to sign the ``.req`` file, and send it back to the OpenVPN server. We assume we have transferred the file from the server machine to the CA machine.

        First we start by plugging the HSM Nitrokey, and enter this instruction for listing the keys available.

        1. Query the list of available devices

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ p11tool --list-all

            **(Required step)** If this is the first time you sign a certificate with the CA, you might want to retrieve the URI of the CA’s private key from the HSM, and include it in the config file.

            .. note:: 
                The key’s URI should be in this format:

                .. code-block:: bash

                    pkcs11:model=PKCS%2315%20emulated;manufacturer=www.CardContact.de;serial=DENK0104068;token=SmartCard-HSM%20%28UserPIN%29%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00;id=%E0%16%1C%C8%B6%F5%D6%6A%C6%83%5E%CD%EC%B6%23%FC%05%06%A6%75;object=root;type=private

        2. Create ``openvpn/`` directory under ``certificate-authority/``

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ mkdir/opt/certificate-authority/
                $ cd /opt/certificate-authority/

        3. Sign the ``server.req``

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ openssl ca -config sign_server_csrs.ini -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -days 375 -notext -md sha512 -create_serial -in server.req -out /home/user/pki/issued/server.crt 

    2. Retrieve the ``server.crt`` file to the server machine

        1. Transfer the signed certificates to the server

            From the CA machine, copy the files ``server.crt`` and ``chain.crt`` to the OpenVPN server. In this example we will use the ``scp`` command as following:

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ scp openvpn/{server.crt,chain.crt} admin@your_openvpnserver_ip:/tmp

        2. Place the certificates on the server’s directory

            .. code-block:: bash

                $ mv /tmp/{server.crt,chain.crt} /etc/openvpn/server

            .. warning::

                CA Certificate and ``chain.crt``

                In the above, the CA returns the signed sever certificate, and
                includes the CA certificate ``CA.crt`` which is the ``chain.crt``
                file. This can be done over an insecure channel, though the client is
                encouraged to confirm if the received ``chain.crt`` is valid, if the
                transport is untrusted.

                It is possible to rename the file ``chain.crt`` file to ``CA.crt`` on
                the target machine, however we will use ``chain.crt`` in the next
                instructions.

6. Configure the OpenVPN server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    A connection that uses TLS requires multiple `certificates and keys for authentication <https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/view/OpenVPN_configuration_examples>`__. Now that we issued and signed those, we can place them in the right directories. The breakdown of the certificates and keys that must be located at the root directory are the following:

    ::

        OpenVPN server 

            - The root certificate file (CA.crt or chain.crt in our setup)
            - Server certificate
            - Server key
            - Diffie Hellman Parameters (optional)

    On your OpenVPN server, now you can create the configuration file ``server.conf`` with your favorite text editor. The file can be configured according to your needs, while we make sure to change the server certificate and key sections according the names you chose for the your the files we signed:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # OpenVPN Server Certificate - CA, server key and certificate
        ca chain.crt
        cert server.crt
        key server.key

    Here is the configuration file we can use for testing these instructions:

    .. code-block:: bash

        port 1194
        proto udp
        dev tun
        ca ca.crt
        cert server.crt
        key server.key  # This file should be kept secret
        dh dh.pem
        server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
        push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
        push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.222.222"
        push "dhcp-option DNS 208.67.220.220"
        keepalive 10 120
        tls-auth ta.key 0 # This file is secret
        cipher AES-256-CBC
        user nobody
        group nogroup
        persist-key
        persist-tun
        status /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
        log         /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log
        log-append  /var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log
        verb 3
        explicit-exit-notify 1
        tls-version-min 1.2 # Lower boundary for TLS version 
        tls-version-max 1.2 # Higher boundary for TLS version

    To test if the configuration functions properly, we can use this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo openvpn --server --config server.conf

7. Start the OpenVPN service on the server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Enable the OpenVPN service by adding it to systemctl, and start it using these commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo systemctl -f enable openvpn@server
        $ sudo systemctl start openvpn@server

    To Double check if the OpenVPN service is active use this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo systemctl status openvpn@server

    The OpenVPN should be running at this point.

--------------

Client side configuration
-------------------------

1. Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. Install the software

        We can use directly ``dnf install`` to install OpenVPN 2.4.9 and Easy-RSA 3.0.7

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ sudo dnf install openvpn easy-rsa

    2. Then we create as non-root a directory for Easy RSA called ``Easy-RSA``

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ mkdir ~/easyrsa

    3. And link it to the Easy RSA package we just installed

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ ln -s /usr/share/easy-rsa/3/* ~/easyrsa/

2. Create a PKI for the OpenVPN client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In the same manner we created a PKI on the OpenVPN server, we will create a PKI using Easy-RSA on the client side.

3. Create a ``client.req`` and ``client.key``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	In the same manner we issued the key pair on the sever, we generate a key pair for the client which will be composed of the ``client.req``
	file and the ``client.key`` file. The latter must be kept secret on the client machine.

4. Sign ``client.req`` and issue the ``client.crt`` file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	To transfer the ``client.req`` file to the CA machine, we will use the same method as we did for the ``server.req`` file.

	Once transferred, on the CA machine we sign the certificate signing request file with this command

	.. code-block:: bash

		$ openssl ca -config sign_server_csrs.ini -engine pkcs11 -keyform engine -days 375 -notext -md sha512 -create_serial -in client.req -out /home/user/pki/issued/client.crt 

5. Import ``client.crt`` on the Nitrokey from the CA machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    After creating the ``client.crt`` file, we plug the Nitrokey Pro 2 device in the CA machine, and import the ``.crt`` to the Pro 2 device using this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pkcs15-init --store-certificate client.crt --id 3

    You can see if the key is effectively stored on the Nitrokey using this command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pkcs15-tool -c

    Or alternatively

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pkcs11-tool --list-objects 

    Fore more commands you can refer to the `OpenSC wiki <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/OpenPGP-card>`__.

6. Retrieve the ``chain.crt`` file from the CA machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    While we keep the ``client.crt``\ stored on the nitrokey Pro 2 device, we must retrieve the ``chain.crt`` file on the client machine, and store it in the adequate directory. We may use ``scp`` as in the method explained in the server section of this guide.

7. Configure the client to interact with the Nitrokey
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Now back on the client machine, we will plug the Nitrokey Pro and use it to establish the VPN connection with the server. In general terms, a connection that uses TLS requires multiple certificates and keys for authentication:

    ::

        OpenVPN client 
            - The root certificate file (`chain.crt`)
            - Client certificate
            - Client key

    For this guide we can the following ``client.conf`` file, and add the required options to it accordingly:

    .. code-block:: bash

        client
        dev tun
        proto udp
        remote <server> 1194
        resolv-retry infinite
        nobind
        user nobody
        group nobody
        persist-key
        persist-tun
        ca ca.crt
        remote-cert-tls server
        cipher AES-256-CBC
        verb 3
        redirect-gateway def1
        tls-version-min 1.2 # Lower boundary for TLS version 
        tls-version-max 1.2 # Higher boundary for TLS version

    1. Determine the correct object

        Each PKCS#11 provider can support multiple devices. In order to view the available object list you can use the following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ openvpn --show-pkcs11-ids /usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so 

            The following objects are available for use.
            Each object shown below may be used as parameter to

            --pkcs11-id option please remember to use single quote mark.

            Certificate
                    DN:             CN=client
                    Serial:         E53DA75C5B8F1518F520BCEF0128C09F
                    Serialized id:  pkcs11:model=pkcs11:model=PKCS%NNNN%20emulated;token=User%20PIN%20%28OpenPGP%20card%29;manufacturer=ZeitControl;serial=000NNNNNN;id=%03

        Each certificate/private key pair have unique ``Serialized id`` string. The serialized id string of the requested certificate should be specified, in the configuration file. We can do this by adding the ``pkcs11-id`` option using single quote marks.

        .. code-block:: bash

            pkcs11-id 'pkcs11:model=pkcs11:model=PKCS%NNNN%20emulated;token=User%20PIN%20%28OpenPGP%20card%29;manufacturer=ZeitControl;serial=000NNNNNN;id=%03'

    2. Add retrieved Serialized ID to the configuration file

        Using your favorite text editor, open the server.conf file, and add the following lines, while taking care to insert your own ``Serialized id``:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pkcs11-providers /usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so
            pkcs11-id 'pkcs11:model=pkcs11:model=PKCS%NNNN%20emulated;token=User%20PIN%20%28OpenPGP%20card%29;manufacturer=ZeitControl;serial=000NNNNNN;id=%03'

        For additional `settings related to OpenVPN <https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/>`__ authentication, you may also add few lines to handle key maganagement, although it is optional.

                pkcs11-id 'pkcs11:model=pkcs11:model=PKCS%NNNN%20emulated;token=User%20PIN%20%28OpenPGP%20card%29;manufacturer=ZeitControl;serial=000NNNNNN;id=%03'
                # pkcs11-pin-cache 300
                # daemon
                # auth-retry nointeract
                # management-hold
                # management-signal
                # management 127.0.0.1 8888
                # management-query-passwords
                pkcs11-cert-private 1 # Prompt for PIN

        Optional step
                    

        If you need to test the configuration, with and without the token on the Nitrokey, you may add lines to the same ``client.conf`` and comment/uncomment the relevant lines according to your needs:

        .. note::

            Click to view the code

            .. code-block:: bash

                # non_nitrokey login
                
                # cert client.crt
                # key client.key
                # tls-auth ta.key 1

    3. Configure the OpenVPN client

		The final configuration file ``client.conf`` should look like this one:

		.. code-block:: bash

			client
			dev tun
			proto udp
			remote <server> 1194
			resolv-retry infinite
			nobind
			user nobody
			group nobody
			persist-key
			persist-tun
			ca ca.crt
			remote-cert-tls server
			cipher AES-256-CBC
			verb 3
			redirect-gateway def1
			tls-version-min 1.2 # Lower boundary for TLS version 
			tls-version-max 1.2 # Higher boundary for TLS version
				
			# nitrokey login

			pkcs11-providers /usr/lib64/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.so
			pkcs11-id 'pkcs11:model=pkcs11:model=PKCS%NNNN%20emulated;token=User%20PIN%20%28OpenPGP%20card%29;manufacturer=ZeitControl;serial=000NNNNNN;id=%03'
			# pkcs11-pin-cache 300
			# daemon
			# auth-retry nointeract
			# management-hold
			# management-signal
			# management 127.0.0.1 8888
			# management-query-passwords
			pkcs11-cert-private 1 # Prompt for PIN
				
			# OR

			# non_nitrokey login

			# cert client.crt
			# key client.key
			# tls-auth ta.key 1


    4. Configure OpenVPN (Windows only)

		In order to establish a handshake, you must configure OpenSSL included in OpenVPN.

		Create the directory ``ssl`` in ``C:\Program Files\OpenVPN`` and create file ``openssl.cnf`` with the following content : 

			openssl_conf = default_conf
				
			[ default_conf ]
			ssl_conf = ssl_sect

			[ ssl_sect ]
			system_default = ssl_default_sect

			[ ssl_default_sect ]
			SignatureAlgorithms = RSA+SHA512:ECDSA+SHA512:RSA+SHA384:ECDSA+SHA384:RSA+SHA256:ECDSA+SHA256
			MaxProtocol = TLSv1.2
			MinProtocol = TLSv1.2


		With this modification, you will not have error as reported `here <https://support.nitrokey.com/t/nitrokey-pro-with-openssl-1-1-1-tls-1-3-and-rsa-based-certificates/2180/2>`__, `here <https://support.nitrokey.com/t/openvpn-openssl-error-141f0006/2637>`__ and `here <https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/1215>`__


    5. Known issues

        There are some known issues related to OpenVPN login with OpenSC. Please consult these issues `here <https://github.com/Nitrokey/wiki/wiki/3rd-Party-Issues>`__.

8. Start the OpenVPN client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    1. Start the OpenVPN service on the client

        Enable the OpenVPN service, and start it using these commands:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ sudo systemctl -f enable openvpn-server@server.service
            $ sudo systemctl start openvpn-server@server.service

        To double check if the OpenVPN service is active use this command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ sudo systemctl status openvpn-server@server.service

    2. Enter your User PIN

        When executing OpenVPN client, Nitrokey’s PIN needs to be entered:

        ::

        In some reported cases it does not prompt for a PIN on the terminal. One workaround would be to use to use this command to login with the PIN:

        ::

            $ telnet 8888 password 'User PIN (OpenPGP card) token' <PIN>

        Alternatively, you could `recompile OpenVPN <https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=23318>`__ client with systemd support disabled, and it will prompt you for the PIN as expected.

        Another option, would be to login to your OpenVPN instance with the Viscosity client which provides a better user experience especially for entering the PIN.
