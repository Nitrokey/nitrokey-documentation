Viscosity Client Configuration with OpenVPN
===========================================

.. product-table:: nk3 start pro storage

.. contents:: :local:

This guide will show to configure `Viscosity client <https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/>`__ to connect to an OpenVPN instance, using a `Nitrokey Pro
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nk-pro-2-nitrokey-pro-2-3>`__ (or `Nitrokey Storage
2 <https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-storage-2-56>`__), and `PKCS#11 authentication <https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#what-is-pkcs11>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

For this guide, you will need an OpenVPN remote server installed and configured for clients. For the purpose of this document, we have used OpenVPN 2.49 installed on a Debian 10 server.

To read about how to configure OpenVPN to authenticate with Nitrokey Pro, you might consult the following `documentation <easyrsa.html>`_, as we will just cover the way to configure the Viscosity client in this guide.

You will also need the following:

-  A Nitrokey Pro 2 or Nitrokey Storage 2

-  Client’s private key ``client.key`` loaded on the Nitrokey

-  Client’s certificate ``client.crt`` loaded on the Nitrokey

-  The Certificate Authority file, i.e. ``CA.crt`` file used for your
   OpenVPN setup

-  Optional: The shared secret key file, i.e. ``ta.key``

For more information on ``PKCS#11`` key management with OpenVPN, please consult OpenVPN’s `documentation. <https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/>`__

Usage
-----

1. Start Viscosity and create a new connection “openVPN” (you can name
   it as you wish)

2. Right click on the connection and click edit

        :scale: 75

3. Add your server’s IP address and configure the port according to your
   configuration.

4. Under authentication, In ``Type`` scroll down to
   ``SSL/TLS Client (PKCS11)``

5. Select the CA file for your connection

    Optional: Select the ``ta.key`` in the ``TLS-Auth`` section

6. Click the Add button next to the Providers field and select the
   ``PKCS#11`` module for your Nitrokey. Multiple providers can be
   specified, and for instance we will use ``OpenSC``.

    On macOS, the most common location for modules to be found is in the
    /usr/lib directory. Please refer to the documentation included with your driver software for the location to use. OpenSC’s module can be found at ``/Library/OpenSC/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so``

    On Windows, the most common location for libraries is either in ``C:\Program Files`` or ``C:\Windows\System32``. OpenSC libraries are generally located at ``C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11``. There may be more than one library available here, you can try each one or simply add both.

7. Choose a retrieval method from the Retrieval drop down menu

    -  If only one Nitrokey will ever be used on this computer, select
       ``Use certificate name below``. If the Nitrokey is currently
       connected to the computer, click the ``Detect`` button for Viscosity
       to automatically fill in the Name field. Otherwise this field can be
       completed manually.

    -  If in doubt, or if more than one Nitrokey may be used (i.e. multiple
       users), then select ``Prompt for certificate name``.

    If ``Prompt for certificate name`` was selected, Viscosity will automatically detect the required key on the Nitrokey, using the specified PKCS#11 module/s. Select from any of the found devices, or enter the name of the ``serialized id`` to use manually. Again, the user should be prompted for a password/PIN if required.

8. Click the Save button and connect from your the main interface

Notes
-----

-  Viscosity is not free, and thus you might run into issues in using
   the free version.

-  We are considering the usage of
   `Pritunl <https://client.pritunl.com/>`__ as a free and open
   alternative.
