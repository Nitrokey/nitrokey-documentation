PIV (Personal Identity Verification)
====================================

.. warning::
   The PIV application of the Nitrokey 3 is currently considered unstable and is not available on the stable firmware releases.
   To obtain that functionality it is required to install a test firmware.
   Subsequent firmware updates may lead to loss of data and cryptographic keys.
   Please refer to `the firmware update documentation <../firmware-update.html#firmware-release-types>`__ for more information.

The *Personal Identity Verfication* (PIV) is based on the NIST special publication `SP 800-73 <https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-73-4.pdf>`__.
