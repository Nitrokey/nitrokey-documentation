Nitrokey FIDO2 FAQ
==================

**Q:** Which Operating Systems are supported?
   Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Also some support (FIDO2) for Android.


**Q:** What can I use the Nitrokey for?
   See the `frontpage`_ for an overview of supported use cases.

**Q:** What happens if I lose my FIDO device?
   When securing accounts using FIDO (two-factor authentication and
   passwordless login), you should configure another factor in your account as
   a backup. Depending on the service this backup factor can be a phone number,
   an app or even a second Nitrokey FIDO2. If you lose a Nitrokey FIDO2, you
   can still log in with the second Nitrokey FIDO2 (or with another second
   factor).

**Q:** How large is the storage capacity?
   The Nitrokey FIDO2 doesn't contain storage capability for ordinary data (it can
   only store cryptographic keys and certificates).

**Q:** How to use Nitrokey FIDO2 with Azure Entra ID (Active Directory)?
   After `disabling Enforce Attestation`_ Nitrokey FIDO2 is supported by Azure Entra ID out of the box.
