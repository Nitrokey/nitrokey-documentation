The Nitrokey 3 supports two-factor authentication (2FA) and
passwordless authentication:

-  With **passwordless authentication**, entering a password is replaced
   by logging in with the Nitrokey 3 and a PIN.

-  With **two-factor authentication** (2FA), the Nitrokey 3 is
   checked in addition to the password.

The Nitrokey 3 can be used with any current browser.

.. important::

   The Nitrokey App can not be used for the Nitrokey 3.

   entering your PIN.
